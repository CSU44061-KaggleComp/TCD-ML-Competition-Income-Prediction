# TCD-ML-Competition-Income-Prediction
Individaul Competition for Machine Learning Module at TCD

incomeprediction.py is the "cleaned up" version of my code on kaggle (e.g. adding comments for clarity, 
removing commented-out code and imported libraries left over from previous version which I no longer used).

kernel551a9b1a47.py is the version of my code as it is on kaggle (i.e. not "cleaned up").
